The Marketing Research Team
  1) we want to see an assorted high-markup product catalog that provides a mental escape for a captive audience.
  2) we want to do market analysis on proposed products to test potential interest from consumers.
  3) we need an app to display those products to individuals in the focus groups.
  4)we want to see the results after 25 selections.

The Developer
  1)I need to generate a random selection of 3 images to display side by side.
  2)I need to record the results, calculate the percentages and then display the results.
  3)I need to make sure images aren't duplicated immediately after a selection.
  4)I need to ensure the results return clean and easy to read on a table.

The Focus Group Participant
  1)I want the page to be appealing and simple.
  2)I want the instructions to be easy to follow.
  3)I want all the images to be the same size so it won't change my choice.
  4)I want the cursor to change, or some indicator telling me when I'm about to select something if I were to press the mouse selector.
